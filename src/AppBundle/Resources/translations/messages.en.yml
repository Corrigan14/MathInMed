  main.part2.headline: Why Did We Create This Website?
  main.part2.text2-1: The first reason is mathematics and its application in a real world. Many students do not understand why they have to learn many 'weird and complicated' formulas, especially in higher grades. For these students the website offers a real mathematical application in a medical assessment of Spirometry.
  main.part2.text2-2: The second reason is motivation. Sometime, only a little help allows self-invention experience which brings intrinsic motivation. Moderated leading offers this help to everybody.
  main.part3.slogan: Dear teacher...
  main.part3.headline: Why Did We Create This Website?
  main.part3.text3-1: Cooperation is crucial in every teacher's development. The internet allows to spread this cooperation out of the schools or regions.
  main.part3.text3-2: It is not important if you are an experienced or a novice teacher. You can find place for your questions, thoughts, research, materials and experience sharing here.
  main.part4.text4-1: The website development is still in progress. Please forgive us any mistakes. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve it, please feel free to contact us.

  martina.part7.headlie: Personal Goals
  martina.part8.headlie: Interests

  martina.part1.supheader-1-1: Why self-directed learning and work with students?
  martina.part1.research-history-1: Short answer for this question is tutoring.
  martina.part1.research-history-2: Thanks to it I met many hard-working students who got a great effort to understand mathematics, but who still did not like it.
  martina.part1.research-history-3: As the answer to this experience I created a web-page with conventional mathematical problems and I researched the unconventional way of solutions there.
  martina.part1.research-history-4: When a student needed a help, system did not provide him with the answer, but it asked a set of questions which led him/her to understand the problem.
  martina.part1.research-history-5: Later, already as a doctor student, I started to work with contextual problems and its potential in self-directed learning.
  martina.part1.research-history-6: We prepared a set of mathematical tasks based on a context of medical assessment which led student from the basic work with a mathematical function to understand derivatives.
  martina.part1.research-history-7: The research showed, that combination of an interesting context and relevant, increasing, difficulty of maths can increase studnets' intrinsic motivation.
  martina.part1.research-history-8: We researched context's attractiveness, problem's complexity, helpers' efficiency and tasks' arrangement and their influence on self-directed learning and intrinsic motivation.
  martina.part1.research-history-9: In 2018 we made an English version of the first part of created contextual problem and we also prepared an online version available on
  martina.part1.research-history-10: In the future, we would like to continue with self-directed learning research with the focus on online education.

  martina.part1.project-3-0: 2019 - current
  martina.part1.project-3-1: Attitude Development Research of Future Mathematics Teachers with the Aim on Innovation of Teacher Education
  martina.part1.project-3-2: It is expected from teachers to lead their students to the ability and willingness to apply school
                             knowledge in real life. Students should have an active and creative approach to problem solving,
                             critical thinking and developed argumentation skills. However, international studies warn, that this is
                             often not the case. The problem can be observed between experienced as well as between beginning
                             teachers. On one hand, teachers do not have enough knowledge about necessary methods and tools
                             to reach that goals. On the other hand, they do not identify themselves with these methods because
                             of their attitude to the learning and teaching. In this project we decided to research factors, which
                             influence the attitude of future mathematics teachers to the goals and teaching of mathematics. Based
                             on the results we would like to prepare recommendations to innovate the university education of future
                             mathematics teachers. The aim of these recommendations is to support creative and inspiring attitude
                             of teachers to the teaching.

  martina.part2.article-1-5: The chapter is devoted to the application of augmented reality (AR) into the teacher-training program at universities.
                           The first part describes the opportunities of future mathematics teachers at the FMFI UK in BA to work with digital technologies.
                           The second, main part, describes the research of the AR application, Augmented Polyhedrons – Mirage 2.2.
                           We conducted two studies with 40 future teachers. Results support the suitability of the selected application and AR in general.
                           However, the implementation has to be precise, with carefully chosen, formulated and requested tasks to solve.
                           The last part of the chapter summarizes useful AR applications for secondary schools.

  martina.part2.article-2-5: This paper reports upon a research project which considered the different approaches
                             of higher grades students to the relevance of a context in contextual mathematical
                             problems. The research involved two groups of students, 28 from upper secondary
                             school and 23 from university. Both groups were asked to solve six mathematical
                             problems and write their opinion about them. The results demonstrate that not all
                             students differentiate between camouflage and real, essential contexts. Additionally,
                             even if students recognise the relevance of a context, it does not influence their
                             motivation to work on the problem as much as originality or personal interest in the
                             context. Even though, the results support usage of contextual problems with real and
                             essential contexts. Contextual problems help students with language barriers.
                             Moreover, real and essential contexts naturally eliminate the tendency of some
                             students to differentiate between in-school mathematics and the out-of-school world.

  martina.part3.student-1-thesis: Methodical Materials for Teaching of Exponential Function
  martina.part3.student-1-name: Mgr. Peter Sás
  martina.part3.student-1-goal: Create and research usability of a methodological material for constructivist teaching of exponential functions at upper-secondary school.
  martina.part3.student-1-abstract: The objective of this master dissertation is to create methodical materials based on
                                    constructivist approach for teaching of exponential functions. The reason for choosing
                                    this topic is a high occurrence of misconception, which basis is the simplifying
                                    mathematical expressions with exponents. Because of this, the focus of the materials is
                                    partially on the possible removal of such misconception. In the theoretical part we present
                                    the principles of constructivist approach to teaching. We then use these principles in the
                                    next section to describe how the materials were actually created. Thus, the practical part
                                    deals specifically with the reasoning of the used parts of the materials, which explains our
                                    direction to reach pre-selected objectives. We will also find here references to the various
                                    adjustments, which materials have required after testing, but without abandoning
                                    mentioned principles.

  martina.part3.student-2-thesis: The Concept of Probability in Mathematical School Problems
  martina.part3.student-2-name: Bc. Thu Nguyen Quynh
  martina.part3.student-2-goal: The aim of the thesis is to compare school mathematical problems corresponding to probability and statistics at upper-secondary school.
                                Identify its goals, principles and its potential in the development of students‘ competencies.
  martina.part3.student-2-abstract: The goal of this study is to analyse and compare the ways the concept of probability is introduced in Vietnamese and Slovak textbooks.
                                    During this study, we raise our concern over these major contents.
                                    1. How the books motivate their students to acquire the new knowledge they present?
                                    2. Which necessary concepts and definitions are presented prior to the concept of probability?
                                    3. What are possible methods to introduce the concept of probability? Which ways the books adopt?
                                    4. How the methods adopted affect their students’ performances?
                                    After comparison, we proceed to analyse and make conclusions on mathematics teaching and
                                    studying in Vietnam and Slovakia. Besides, at the end of the chapter, we also discuss
                                    innovation in teaching and studying mathematics in general and probability segment in particular.

  martina.part6.text-1: From students' survey
  martina.part6.reference.student-1: Thanks to Ms. Babinská we managed this subject very well even though we did not have a mathematical education before. Although it was a lot of work, writing test every lecture and also homeworks, we were looking forward to these lectures. The subject was very well explained and I think everybody understood it. Thanks.
  martina.part6.reference.student-2: Ms. Martina Babinská was great!! always very well prepared, encouraging, fitting the lectures to the student's needs!
  martina.part6.reference.student-3: It was compensatory course for me. It helped me a lot. I really appreaciated approach of Ms. Babinská. She was really good in explanation and she had patience with us, what was definitelly not easy.
  martina.part6.reference.student-4: Very nice and helpful. Really motivating during class.
  martina.part6.reference.student-5: We passed all necessary excercises, moreover, Ms. Babinska always led us to think about what we are doing (counting), why we are working in that way, why it actually works, when we can use the counting method and when we can not. One of the nicest lecturers at the faculty. :)
  martina.part6.reference.student-7: A great teacher, I particulary appreciate the approach that motivated us to go to the blackboard and explain problems to each other.
  martina.part6.reference.student-8: Ms. Babinska always well and easily explained things to someone who did not understand and after these lectures I felt that I understand completely everything.

  introduction.part2.slogan: A Medical Assessment
  introduction.part2.headline:  Spirometry?
  introduction.part2.text2-1: Spirometry is a medical assessment which helps doctors to test the pulmonary function - function of our lungs. Practically, it measures the movement of air into and out of the lungs.
  introduction.part2.text2-2: Spirometry in the past
  introduction.part2.text2-3: One of the first constructed spirometers was named WATER SPIROMETER. As you can see at the picture (left), the patient was breathing into a machine. Simultaneously, the machine was drawing the graph - spirometry curve.
  introduction.part2.text2-4: Spirometry today
  introduction.part2.text2-5: Modern spirometers are small computer machines connected to the breathing mouthpiece (picture right). Assessment result is printed out.
  introduction.part3.slogan: Help of a computer
  introduction.part3.headline:  Spirometry Result
  introduction.part3.text3-1: To help a doctor make a diagnosis, the modern spirometry result does not contain only siprometry curve, but also
  introduction.part3.text3-2: o Key measured values
  introduction.part3.text3-3: o Volume-Time curve
  introduction.part3.text3-4: o Flow-Volume loop
  introduction.part3.text3-5: o Comparable values (values, which should be achieved by a healthy man/woman)
  introduction.part3.text3-6: Our task for the next pages is to find out how the computer creates this result. And also find out what the numbers and curves can tell the doctor about the patients' healthy conditions.

  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-1: One of the main parameters, which indicates respiratory problems, is a (FORCED) VITAL CAPACITY (FVC).
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-2: FVC represents the volume of air maximally fiercely breathed out after the deep inhalation.
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-3: The healthy, non-smoker human's FVC is defined by
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-4: TABLES
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-5: If the patient's FVC is different from the table - predicted value, it can signalize a disease.
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-6: Why do we need this information?
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-7: Our first task is to FIND PATIENT'S FORCED VITAL CAPACITY and to COMPARE IT with a table (predicted) value. If there is nearly no difference between these two values, we can expect, that our patient does not have any breathing problems.
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text2-1: The first patient

  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-1: Solution of the Problem 1.2 showed us, that our patien's FVC (FORCED VITAL CAPACITY) is
  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-2: decreased/reduced.
  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-3: But, what does it mean? What kind of a disease can our patient have?
  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-4: To answer this question we need to know, what kind of pulmonary diseases exist. The list of existed pulmonary diseases and their description is available
  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-5: HERE.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text1-1: Solution of the Problem 1.2 showed us, that our patien's FVC (FORCED VITAL CAPACITY) is  decreased/reduced. As you probably remember, to find this fact, we had to go to the table and find FVC value manually. That was quite time consuming and it could be very annoying if we have to repeat it many times.  To help the doctor and save his time a real spirometry result already contains these table/ideal values of a healthy human.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text1-2: These values are usually adduced in the brackets or in the next column. There also can be a healthy human's spirometry curve graph marked by a dashed line included in a patient's measured spirometry curve graph.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text1-3: If we want to create this healthy human's spirometry curve, it is necessary to know a Forced Vital Capacity parameter. Hovewer, it is not enough. We also need to know parameters like Tidal Volume, Expiratory Reserve Volume, Inspiratory Reserve Volume and Residual Volume.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text2-1: Tidal Volume (TD)
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text2-2-1: the volume of an air moved into or out of the lungs during quiet breathing (it is bordered by
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text2-2-2: the red dashed-lines
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text2-2-3: on the right graph
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text2-3: The healthy adult's TV value should be 15 - 18 % of his Forced Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text3-1: Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV)
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text3-2: the maximal volume of an air that can be exhaled from the end-expiratory position.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text3-3: The healthy adult's ERV should be 25 % of his Forced Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text4-1: Inspiratory Reserve Volume (ERV)
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text4-2: the maximal volume of an air that can be inhaled from the end-inspiratory level.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text4-3: The healthy adult's IRV should be 60 % of his Forced Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text5-1: Residual Volume (RV)
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text5-2: the volume of an air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text5-3: It is not possible to measure this volume directlly and we are not working deeper with it now.
  first-chapter.problem-1-1: What is the patient's Forced Vital Capacity?
  first-chapter.problem-1-2-1: Is there a difference between our patient's measured forced vital capacity and a forced vital capacity of a healthy, 56 years old, 171 cm high man?

  first-chapter.problem-1-4-1: Use the spirometry curve of our patient (placed next to the
  first-chapter.problem-1-4-2: problem 1.1
  first-chapter.problem-1-4-3: and find his Tidal Volume, Expiratory Reserve Volume and Inspiratory Reserve Volume.
  first-chapter.problem-1-5-1: Count TV, ERV and IRV values of a healthy, 56-years old man, who is not smoking and who is 171cm tall.
  first-chapter.problem-1-5-2: Compare these values with the values reached by our patient.
  first-chapter.problem-1-6-1: Take the spirometry curve of our patient (placed next to the
  first-chapter.problem-1-6-2: and to the same graph create a spiromtery curve of a healthy, 56-years old man, non-smoker, 171cm tall.

  first-chapter.result.text1-4: we already know!
  first-chapter.result.text2-1: RED BORDERED GRAPH
  first-chapter.result.text2-2: It is a different representation of a Spirometry curve from the previous problems (problem 1.1 - 1.6)
  first-chapter.result.text2-3: The first rectangle represents values of a healthy human (predict values).
  first-chapter.result.text2-4: The second and the third rectangle represent the result of a patient (the first one - stats from the first measurement, the second one - stats from the second measurement).
  first-chapter.result.text2-5: If the doctor compare these three graphs, he/she can immediately recognize, if the patient's measured values are increased/decreased or normal.
  first-chapter.result.text3-1: ORANGE BORDERED GRAPH
  first-chapter.result.text3-2: The difference between FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) and VC (Slow Vital Capacity) is in the exhalation.
  first-chapter.result.text3-3: If the doctor asks patient to exhale calmly and slowly, we talk about Slow Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.result.text3-4: Contrarily, if the patient exhales forcefully and quickly, we talk about Forced Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.result.text3-5: The volume of an exhaled air should be, for a healhy human, equal in the both cases. If there is a big difference, we can expect, that our patient suffers by Obstructive disease.
  first-chapter.result.text3-6: It is not necessary to differentiate between FVC and VC values for us.
  first-chapter.result.next: Finally... PLAY TIME
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-1: There were many famous doctors studying human Vital Capacity during the last centuries.
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-2: One of the first was Galen, well-known famous Greek doctor (2th century).
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-3: Later, Giovannin Alfonso Borelli (1679) rapidly increased the measurement accuracy, using the patient's nose blocking.
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-4: John Hutchinson (1849) created the first fully functional spirometer (water spirometer). Later, based on 4000 measurements, found a linear dependence between the vital capacity and a human height.
  table.FVC-text-introduction: As a height unit, INCH is used in a table. Inches are usually used in an anglophone districts, most common in the USA and the United Kingdom (1 inch = 2.54 cm).

  diseases.table1.text-11: PEF is reduced or normal
  diseases.table2.text-11: PEF is reduced below 80% of a predicted value. The reduction is increasing with the disease substantiality (ASTHMA - low reduction, COPD - height reduction).
  diseases.table1.text-12: Forced expiratory flow (FEF)
  diseases.table2.text-13: FEF25, FEF50 and FEF75 are reduced below 50% of a predicted value. The reduction is increasing with the disease substantiality.

  diseases.table1.text-14: Flow-Volume Loop shape
  diseases.table1.text-15: Concave in a volume axis direction
  diseases.table2.text-15: Convex in a volume axis direction
  diseases.note-1: The table does not contain PEAK INSPIRATORY FLOW (PIF) which represents the maximal air flow during the patient's inhalation. The reason is medical. The inspiration curve is less influenced by the lung defects as the expiratory curve. If the value of this parameter is reduced compared to the expected value, we usually have to find the cause outside of the lung (e.g. trachea cancer).
  diseases.note-2: COPD is one of the most common pulmonary obstructive diseases, mostly caused by smoking. There are two COPD forms - chronical bronchitis and aerification. Patients suffering from COPD usually have both of these forms.
  diseases.part-11-text-1: Restrictive pulmonary diseases are also known as restrictive ventilatory defects or interstitial lung diseases.
  diseases.part-11-header-1: What is happening in a patient's respiratory system?
  diseases.part-11-text-2: The lung tissue is defected what causes decreased air volume stored in a lung.

  diseases.part-11-header-3: What are the causes of restrictive lung diseases?
  diseases.part-11-text-3: The causes can be splited into the two main categories
  diseases.part-11-text-3-1: Extrinsic (they are influencing the chest wall movement)

  diseases.part-11-text-3-2-2: Sarcoidosis
  diseases.part-11-text-3-2-3: Pulmonary fibrosis
  diseases.part-11-text-3-2-4: ...
  diseases.part-12-text-1: Bronchi and bronchioles are narrowed what caueses the airway obstruction. The result of the obstruction is a reduction of a quickly exhaled air.
  diseases.part-12-text-3-1: Asthma
  diseases.part-12-text-3-2: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
  diseases.part-13-text-1: The restrictive and obstructive disease combination can be caused by two different diseases where the first one is restrictive and the second one is obstructive.
  diseases.part-13-text-2: Another option is, if the disease causes both - restrictive as well as obstructive pulmonary defects. The example of this kind of disease is a cystic fibrosis.

  game.part1.task2.text1-2: They had to find volume of an air inhaled during their normal breathing.
  game.part1.task2.text2-1: After a while Sophi said
  game.part1.task2.text2-2: It is very interesting! The result does not change if I move the graph of the spirometry curve across the paper.
  game.part1.task2.text2-3: For example, like this!
  game.part1.task2.text2-4: (look on the right graph)
  game.part1.task2.text3-1: Is Sophi true?
  game.part1.task2.text3-2: What is the volume of an inhaled air in Sophi's example?
  game.part1.task2.answer1: Yes, Sophi is true. The volume of the normally inhaled air is approximately 600 ml
  game.part1.task2.answer2: No, Sophi is not true
  game.part1.task2.answer3: We do not know
  game.part1.task2.answer4: Yes, Sophi is true. The volume of the normally inhaled air is approximately 200 ml
  game.part1.task3.header: Frequency - the number of repetitions
  game.part1.task3.text1-1: The last task of our students was to find a
  game.part1.task3.text1-2: breathing frequency
  game.part1.task3.text1-3: the number of repetitions of a normal inhalation and exhalation cycles in one minute
  game.part1.task3.text1-4: They worked with a spirometry curve drawn on the right picture
  game.part1.task3.text2: Which is the correct answer?
  game.part1.task3.answer1: It is not possible to find the answer because we do not have the record of breading for the whole minute
  game.part1.task4.header: A little bit of "pure" maths
  game.part1.task4.text1: The next task has two alternatives
  game.part1.task4.text2-1: Do you know a
  game.part1.task4.text2-2: sinus
  game.part1.task4.text2-3: function
  game.part1.task4.text3-1: If no, pick up
  game.part1.task4.text3-2: the first alternative
  game.part1.task4.text4-1: If you already know it, the first alternative could not be interesting for you a from that reason we prepared
  game.part1.task4.text4-2: the second alternative
  game.part1.task4.text4-3: for you
  game.part1.task4.text5: If you want, you can both variants! In this way you can check the accuracy of your your answer

  game.part1.task4-1.text2-2: sinus
  game.part1.task4-1.text3-1: The graph is then
  game.part1.task4-1.text3-2: graph of a sinus function
  game.part1.task4-1.text4: Which of the next propositions are true for this graph
  game.part1.task4-1.text5-1: Dependent variable
  game.part1.task4-1.text5-2: only gets values of interval
  game.part1.task4-1.text6-1: If independent variable
  game.part1.task4-1.text6-2: the value of a dependent variable
  game.part1.task4-1.text6-3: is
  game.part1.task4-1.text7-1: If independent variable
  game.part1.task4-1.text7-2: its increasing values bring also increase of a
  game.part1.task4-1.text7-3: variable values
  game.part1.task4-1.text8-1: Values of a dependent variable
