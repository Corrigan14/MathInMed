  headline.text: Hi everybody! My name is Martina. I am a teacher, researcher and free-time PHP web-developer. I am a proud holder of PhD. degree from The Theory of Teaching of Mathematics. I know that mathematics can be challenging but it can be a good chalenge and everybody can learn it. The only question is, how. One of the effective ways is to doscover it by yourself!

  main.citation: Let the main object... to seek and to find a method of instruction, by which teachers may teach less, but learners learn more.
  main.author.citation: John Amos Comenius
  main.part1.slogan: Dear visitor...
  main.part1.headline: Who Are We?
  main.part1-1.text: We are a team of young researchers with the main work place at Comenius University in Bratislava. Our research is focused on a student's learning practice in mathematics, self-inner-motivation and tutoring.
  main.part1-2.text: The main goal of our work is to find ways to help students with mathematics understanding and their mathematics learning inner-motivation.
  main.part2.slogan: We work with passion ... for students
  main.part2.headline: Why Did We Create This Website?
  main.part2.text2-1: The first reason is Mathematics an its practicality - real-world usage. Many students do not understand why they have to learn many "weird and complicated" formulas, especially in a higher grade. For these students website offers a real mathematical application in a medical assessment called Spirometry. Students have the opportunity to understand a crucial Mathematical Functions role in this assessment's result creation.
  main.part2.text2-2: The second reason is Mathematics understanding. Sometime, only small help can open student's understanding and allows self-invention experience which brings inner-motivation. Moderated Online Tutoring is offering this help for everybody who likes to us it.
  main.part3.slogan: We work with passion ... for teachers
  main.part3.headline: What is This Website offering for Teachers?
  main.part3.text3-1: Cooperation is crucial in an excellent teacher development. Internet allows to spread this cooperation out of schools or regions.
  main.part3.text3-2: It is not important if you are an experienced or novice teacher. You can find a place for your questions, thoughts, research, materials and experience sharing here.
  main.part4.text4-1: The website development is still in progress. Please forgive us mistakes. If you have any suggestion how we can improwe, please feel free to contact us.

  introduction.citation: No other person's ideas, and none of my own ideas, are as authoritative as my experience.
  introduction.author.citation: Carl Rogers
  introduction.part1.slogan: Mathematics doesn't have to be an "apparition"
  introduction.part1.headline: Mathematics in Medicine
  introduction.part1.text1-1: You had probably already heard about the "importance of mathematics in medicine". But, are you asking why? Why is it so important? How can we REALY use our mathematical knowledge in this field?
  introduction.part1.text1-2: The answer to these questions is offered on the next pages.
  introduction.part1.text1-3: We are looking together on a result of medical assessment called SPIROMETRY. We are going through this result and constructing it from the measured values.
  introduction.part2.slogan: A Medical Assessment
  introduction.part2.headline:  Spirometry?
  introduction.part2.text2-1: Spirometry is a medical assessment which helps doctors to test the pulmonary function - function of our lungs. Practically, it measures the movement of air into and out of the lungs.
  introduction.part2.text2-2: Spirometry in the past
  introduction.part2.text2-3: One of the first constructed spirometer is called WATER SPIROMETER. As you can see in the picture (left), the patient was breathing into a machine. The machine was drawing graph - spirometry curve based on the patient's breathing intensity.
  introduction.part2.text2-4: Spirometry today
  introduction.part2.text2-5: Modern spirometers are small computer machines connected to the breathing mouthpiece (picture right). Assessment result is printed from the computer to the paper sheet.
  introduction.part3.slogan: Computers help
  introduction.part3.headline:  Spirometry Result
  introduction.part3.text3-1: To help a doctor make a diagnosis, the modern computer assessment result does not contain only siprometry curve, but also:
  introduction.part3.text3-2: o Key measured values
  introduction.part3.text3-3: o Volume-time curve
  introduction.part3.text3-4: o Flow-Volume loop
  introduction.part3.text3-5: o Comparable values (values, which should be achieved by the healthy man/woman)
  introduction.part3.text3-6: To understand how this WHOLE result is beeing created inside "in the computer" and what the numbers and curves can tell the doctor about patients healthy conditions - these are our tasks for the next pages.
  introduction.part4.slogan: Mathematics hidden inside
  introduction.part4.headline: What can I expect from Mathematics?
  introduction.part4.text4-1: o Functions and its characteristics
  introduction.part4.text4-2: o Graphs and formulas
  introduction.part4.text4-3: o Derivatives
  introduction.part4.text4-4: o Reading with understanding
  introduction.part4.text4-5: o Deduction
  introduction.part4.text4-6: And much more...
  introduction.part5.slogan: Is it difficult?
  introduction.part5.headline: Do I Need To Know "a lot of" From Mathematics?
  introduction.part5.text5-1: The answer is NO. Do not be worried! The only things what you need  are a little bit of time and a mode of thinking ;).
  introduction.part5.text5-2: Every problem what is waiting for you contains HELPER. This you can find in a right menu, under the BULB icon. You can use these helpers every time, when you need.
  introduction.nextPage: Let's look closer on the Spirometry result
  result.headline: SPIROMETRY -  pulmonary function test
  result.part1.text1-1: WHAT DOES THE RESULT CONTAIN?
  result.part1.text1-2: As you can see, many numbers and graphs :)
