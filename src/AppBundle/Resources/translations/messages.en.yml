  main.citation: To seek and to find a method of instruction, by which teachers may teach less, but learners learn more.
  main.author.citation: John Amos Comenius
  main.part1.slogan: Dear visitor...
  main.part1.headline: Who Are We?
  main.part1-1.text: We are a team of young researchers with the main work place at Comenius University in Bratislava. Our research focuses on a learning of mathematics, student's work, self-study, intrinsic motivation and preparation for future mathematics' teachers.
  main.part2.slogan: Dear student...
  main.part2.headline: Why Did We Create This Website?
  main.part2.text2-1: The first reason is mathematics and its application in a real world. Many students do not understand why they have to learn many 'weird and complicated' formulas, especially in higher grades. For these students the website offers a real mathematical application in a medical assessment of Spirometry.
  main.part2.text2-2: The second reason is motivation. Sometime, only a little help allows self-invention experience which brings intrinsic motivation. Moderated leading offers this help to everybody.
  main.part3.slogan: Dear teacher...
  main.part3.headline: Why Did We Create This Website?
  main.part3.text3-1: Cooperation is crucial in every teacher's development. The internet allows to spread this cooperation out of the schools or regions.
  main.part3.text3-2: It is not important if you are an experienced or a novice teacher. You can find place for your questions, thoughts, research, materials and experience sharing here.
  main.part4.text4-1: The website development is still in progress. Please forgive us any mistakes. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve it, please feel free to contact us.

  martina.part1.research-history-1: Short answer for this question is tutoring.
  martina.part1.research-history-2: Thanks to it I met many hard-working students who got a great effort to understand mathematics, but who still did not like it.
  martina.part1.research-history-3: As the answer to this experience I created a web-page with conventional mathematical problems and I researched the unconventional way of solutions there.
  martina.part1.research-history-4: When a student needed a help, system did not provide him with the answer, but it asked a set of questions which led him/her to understand the problem.
  martina.part1.research-history-5: Later, already as a doctor student, I started to work with contextual problems and its potential in self-study.
  martina.part1.research-history-6: We prepared a set of mathematical tasks based on a context of medical assessment which led student from the basic work with a mathematical function to understand derivatives.
  martina.part1.research-history-7: The research showed, that combination of an interesting context and relevant, increasing, difficulty of maths can increase studnets' intrinsic motivation.

  martina.part6.text-1: From students' survey
  martina.part6.reference.student-1: Thanks to Ms. Babinská we managed this subject very well even though we did not have a mathematical education before. Although it was a lot of work, writing test every lecture and also homeworks, we were looking forward to these lectures. The subject was very well explained and I think everybody understood it. Thanks.
  martina.part6.reference.student-2: Ms. Martina Babinská was great!! always very well prepared, encouraging, fitting the lectures to the student's needs!
  martina.part6.reference.student-3: It was compensatory course for me. It helped me a lot. I really appreaciated approach of Ms. Babinská. She was really good in explanation and she had patience with us, what was definitelly not easy.
  martina.part6.reference.student-4: Very nice and helpful. Really motivating during class.
  martina.part6.reference.student-5: We passed all necessary excercises, moreover, Ms. Babinska always led us to think about what we are doing (counting), why we are working in that way, why it actually works, when we can use the counting method and when we can not. One of the nicest lecturers at the faculty. :)
  martina.part6.reference.student-7: A great teacher, I particulary appreciate the approach that motivated us to go to the blackboard and explain problems to each other.
  martina.part6.reference.student-8: Ms. Babinska always well and easily explained things to someone who did not understand and after these lectures I felt that I understand completely everything.

  introduction.part2.text2-1: Spirometry is a medical assessment which helps doctors to test the pulmonary function - function of our lungs. Practically, it measures the movement of air into and out of the lungs.
  introduction.part2.text2-2: Spirometry in the past
  introduction.part2.text2-3: One of the first constructed spirometers was named WATER SPIROMETER. As you can see at the picture (left), the patient was breathing into a machine. Simultaneously, the machine was drawing the graph - spirometry curve.
  introduction.part2.text2-4: Spirometry today
  introduction.part2.text2-5: Modern spirometers are small computer machines connected to the breathing mouthpiece (picture right). Assessment result is printed out.
  introduction.part3.slogan: Help of a computer

  introduction.part3.text3-3: o Volume-Time curve
  introduction.part3.text3-4: o Flow-Volume loop
  introduction.part3.text3-5: o Comparable values (values, which should be achieved by a healthy man/woman)
  introduction.part3.text3-6: Our task for the next pages is to find out how the computer creates this result. And also find out what the numbers and curves can tell the doctor about the patients' healthy conditions.

  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-1: One of the main parameters, which indicates respiratory problems, is a (FORCED) VITAL CAPACITY (FVC).
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-2: FVC represents the volume of air maximally fiercely breathed out after the deep inhalation.
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-3: The healthy, non-smoker human's FVC is defined by
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-4: TABLES
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-5: If the patient's FVC is different from the table - predicted value, it can signalize a disease.
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-6: Why do we need this information?
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-7: Our first task is to FIND PATIENT'S FORCED VITAL CAPACITY and to COMPARE IT with a table (predicted) value. If there is nearly no difference between these two values, we can expect, that our patient does not have any breathing problems.
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text2-1: The first patient

  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-1: Solution of the Problem 1.2 showed us, that our patien's FVC (FORCED VITAL CAPACITY) is
  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-2: decreased/reduced.
  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-3: But, what does it mean? What kind of a disease can our patient have?
  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-4: To answer this question we need to know, what kind of pulmonary diseases exist. The list of existed pulmonary diseases and their description is available
  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-5: HERE.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text1-1: Solution of the Problem 1.2 showed us, that our patien's FVC (FORCED VITAL CAPACITY) is  decreased/reduced. As you probably remember, to find this fact, we had to go to the table and find FVC value manually. That was quite time consuming and it could be very annoying if we have to repeat it many times.  To help the doctor and save his time a real spirometry result already contains these table/ideal values of a healthy human.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text1-2: These values are usually adduced in the brackets or in the next column. There also can be a healthy human's spirometry curve graph marked by a dashed line included in a patient's measured spirometry curve graph.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text1-3: If we want to create this healthy human's spirometry curve, it is necessary to know a Forced Vital Capacity parameter. Hovewer, it is not enough. We also need to know parameters like Tidal Volume, Expiratory Reserve Volume, Inspiratory Reserve Volume and Residual Volume.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text2-1: Tidal Volume (TD)
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text2-2-1: the volume of an air moved into or out of the lungs during quiet breathing (it is bordered by

  first-chapter.supchapter3.text2-3: The healthy adult's TV value should be 15 - 18 % of his Forced Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text3-1: Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV)
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text3-2: the maximal volume of an air that can be exhaled from the end-expiratory position.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text3-3: The healthy adult's ERV should be 25 % of his Forced Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text4-1: Inspiratory Reserve Volume (ERV)
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text4-2: the maximal volume of an air that can be inhaled from the end-inspiratory level.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text4-3: The healthy adult's IRV should be 60 % of his Forced Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text5-1: Residual Volume (RV)
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text5-2: the volume of an air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text5-3: It is not possible to measure this volume directlly and we are not working deeper with it now.
  first-chapter.problem-1-1: What is the patient's Forced Vital Capacity?

  first-chapter.result.text2-4: The second and the third rectangle represent the result of a patient (the first one - stats from the first measurement, the second one - stats from the second measurement).
  first-chapter.result.text2-5: If the doctor compare these three graphs, he/she can immediately recognize, if the patient's measured values are increased/decreased or normal.
  first-chapter.result.text3-1: ORANGE BORDERED GRAPH
  first-chapter.result.text3-2: The difference between FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) and VC (Slow Vital Capacity) is in the exhalation.
  first-chapter.result.text3-3: If the doctor asks patient to exhale calmly and slowly, we talk about Slow Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.result.text3-4: Contrarily, if the patient exhales forcefully and quickly, we talk about Forced Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.result.text3-5: The volume of an exhaled air should be, for a healhy human, equal in the both cases. If there is a big difference, we can expect, that our patient suffers by Obstructive disease.
  first-chapter.result.text3-6: It is not necessary to differentiate between FVC and VC values for us.
  first-chapter.result.next: Finally... PLAY TIME
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-1: There were many famous doctors studying human Vital Capacity during the last centuries.
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-2: One of the first was Galen, well-known famous Greek doctor (2th century).
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-3: Later, Giovannin Alfonso Borelli (1679) rapidly increased the measurement accuracy, using the patient's nose blocking.
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-4: John Hutchinson (1849) created the first fully functional spirometer (water spirometer). Later, based on 4000 measurements, found a linear dependence between the vital capacity and a human height.
  table.FVC-text-introduction: As a height unit, INCH is used in a table. Inches are usually used in an anglophone districts, most common in the USA and the United Kingdom (1 inch = 2.54 cm).

  diseases.header: Pulmonary diseases
  diseases.introduction: Pulmonary diseases can be divided into three groups.
  diseases.header-11: Restrictive lung diseases
  diseases.header-12: Obstructive lung diseases
  diseases.header-13: Restrictive and Obstructive lung diseases combination
  diseases.header-14: Spirometry is not the only one assessment necessary to diagnose and to confirm a patient's disease. Very important are also -  patient's anamnesis, x-ray, CT scan, bronchoscopy and others.
  diseases.table1.text-1: Restrictive lung diseases - Spirometry results
  diseases.table2.text-1: Obstructive lung diseases - Spirometry results
  diseases.table1.text-2: Parameter
  diseases.table1.text-3: A comparison of a spirometry assessment and predicted values
  diseases.table1.text-4: Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)
  diseases.table1.text-5: FVC is reduced below 80% of a predicted value
  diseases.table2.text-5: FVC is normal or nearly normal (lightly decreased)
  diseases.table1.text-6: Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)
  diseases.table1.text-7: FEV1 is reduced below 80% of a predicted value
  diseases.table1.text-8: FEV1/FVC ratio (FEV1%)
  diseases.table1.text-9: FEV1/FVC ratio is normal (value = 1)
  diseases.table2.text-9: FEV1/FVC ratio is reduced on a value 0.7 or less (max value = 1)
  diseases.table1.text-10: Peak expiratory flow (PEF)
  diseases.table1.text-11: PEF is reduced or normal
  diseases.table2.text-11: PEF is reduced below 80% of a predicted value. The reduction is increasing with the disease substantiality (ASTHMA - low reduction, COPD - height reduction).
  diseases.table1.text-12: Forced expiratory flow (FEF)
  diseases.table2.text-13: FEF25, FEF50 and FEF75 are reduced below 50% of a predicted value. The reduction is increasing with the disease substantiality.
  diseases.table1.text-13: FEF25, FEF50 and FEF75 values can be lightly reduced or extended, based on a FVC change
  diseases.table1.text-14: Flow-Volume Loop shape
  diseases.table1.text-15: Concave in a volume axis direction
  diseases.table2.text-15: Convex in a volume axis direction
  diseases.note-1: The table does not contain PEAK INSPIRATORY FLOW (PIF) which represents the maximal air flow during the patient's inhalation. The reason is medical. The inspiration curve is less influenced by the lung defects as the expiratory curve. If the value of this parameter is reduced compared to the expected value, we usually have to find the cause outside of the lung (e.g. trachea cancer).
  diseases.note-2: COPD is one of the most common pulmonary obstructive diseases, mostly caused by smoking. There are two COPD forms - chronical bronchitis and aerification. Patients suffering from COPD usually have both of these forms.
  diseases.part-11-text-1: Restrictive pulmonary diseases are also known as restrictive ventilatory defects or interstitial lung diseases.
  diseases.part-11-header-1: What is happening in a patient's respiratory system?
  diseases.part-11-text-2: The lung tissue is defected what causes decreased air volume stored in a lung.
  diseases.part-11-header-2: How are the restrictive lung diseases demonstrated by the Spirometry assessment?
  diseases.part-11-header-3: What are the causes of restrictive lung diseases?
  diseases.part-11-text-3: The causes can be splited into the two main categories
  diseases.part-11-text-3-1: Extrinsic (they are influencing the chest wall movement)
  diseases.part-11-text-3-1-1: Obesity
  diseases.part-11-text-3-1-2: Scoliosis
  diseases.part-11-text-3-1-3: Respiratory muscle defects
  diseases.part-11-text-3-1-4: ...
  diseases.part-11-text-3-2: Intrinsic (they are influencing the lung elasticity)
  diseases.part-11-text-3-2-1: Partial surgery lung removal
  diseases.part-11-text-3-2-2: Sarcoidosis
  diseases.part-11-text-3-2-3: Pulmonary fibrosis
  diseases.part-11-text-3-2-4: ...
  diseases.part-12-text-1: Bronchi and bronchioles are narrowed what caueses the airway obstruction. The result of the obstruction is a reduction of a quickly exhaled air.
  diseases.part-12-text-3-1: Asthma
  diseases.part-12-text-3-2: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
  diseases.part-13-text-1: The restrictive and obstructive disease combination can be caused by two different diseases where the first one is restrictive and the second one is obstructive.
  diseases.part-13-text-2: Another option is, if the disease causes both - restrictive as well as obstructive pulmonary defects. The example of this kind of disease is a cystic fibrosis.

  game.part1.task2.text1-2: They had to find volume of an air inhaled during their normal breathing.
  game.part1.task2.text2-1: After a while Sophi said
  game.part1.task2.text2-2: It is very interesting! The result does not change if I move the graph of the spirometry curve across the paper.
