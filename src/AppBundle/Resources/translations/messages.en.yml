  introduction.part1.slogan: Mathematics doesn't have to be an "apparition"
  introduction.part1.headline: Mathematics in Medicine
  introduction.part1.text1-1: Have you ever heard about the "importance of mathematics in medicine". Do you believe it? Can you imagine why should be mathematics important to medicine? How can we REALY use our mathematical knowledge in this field?
  introduction.part1.text1-2: The answer to these questions is offered on the next pages.
  introduction.part1.text1-3: We are looking together to a result of medical assessment called SPIROMETRY. By solving small problems, step by step, we are discovering how this result is constructed and why is the mathematics necessary in this process.
  introduction.part2.slogan: A Medical Assessment
  introduction.part2.headline:  Spirometry?
  introduction.part2.text2-1: Spirometry is a medical assessment which helps doctors to test the pulmonary function - function of our lungs. Practically, it measures the movement of air into and out of the lungs.
  introduction.part2.text2-2: Spirometry in the past
  introduction.part2.text2-3: One of the first constructed spirometer is called WATER SPIROMETER. As you can see in the picture (left), the patient was breathing into a machine. The machine was drawing graph - spirometry curve based on the patient's breathing intensity.
  introduction.part2.text2-4: Spirometry today
  introduction.part2.text2-5: Modern spirometers are small computer machines connected to the breathing mouthpiece (picture right). Assessment result is printed from the computer to the paper sheet.
  introduction.part3.slogan: Computers help
  introduction.part3.headline:  Spirometry Result
  introduction.part3.text3-1: To help a doctor make a diagnosis, the modern computer assessment result does not contain only siprometry curve, but also:
  introduction.part3.text3-2: o Key measured values
  introduction.part3.text3-3: o Volume-Time curve
  introduction.part3.text3-4: o Flow-Volume loop
  introduction.part3.text3-5: o Comparable values (values, which should be achieved by a healthy man/woman)
  introduction.part3.text3-6: To understand how this WHOLE result is beeing created inside "in the computer" and what the numbers and curves can tell the doctor about patients healthy conditions - these are our tasks for the next pages.
  introduction.part4.slogan: Mathematics hidden inside
  introduction.part4.headline: What can I expect from Mathematics?
  introduction.part4.text4-1: o Functions and its characteristics

  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-3: The healthy, non-smoker human's FVC is defined by
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-4: TABLES
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-5: If the patient's FVC is different from the table - predicted value, it can signalize various types of diseases.
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-6: Why do we need this information?
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-7: Our first task is to FIND PATIENT'S FORCED VITAL CAPACITY and to COMPARE IT with a table (predicted) value. If there is nearly no difference between these two values, we are not expecting patient's lung function problems.
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text2-1: The first patient

  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-1: The Problem 1.2 solution showed us, that our patien's FVC (FORCED VITAL CAPACITY) is
  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-2: decreased/reduced.
  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-3: But, what does it mean? What kind of a disease can our patient have?
  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-4: To answer this question we need to know, what kind of pulmonary diseases exist. The list of existed pulmonary diseases and their description is available
  first-chapter.supchapter2.text1-5: HERE.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text1-1: The Problem 1.2 solution showed us, that our patien's FVC (FORCED VITAL CAPACITY) is  decreased/reduced. As you probably remember, to find this fact, we had to go to the table and find FVC value manually. To help a doctor and save his time a real spirometry result does not contain only measured values, but also these ideal values - values what should have a healthy human.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text1-2: These values are usually adduced in brackets or in the next column or there is a healthy human's spirometry curve chart marked by a dashed line included in a patient's measured spirometry curve chart.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text1-3: If we want to create this healthy human's spirometry curve, it is necessary to know a Forced Vital Capacity parameter, but it is not enough. Also parameters like Tidal Volume, Expiratory Reserve Volume, Inspiratory Reserve Volume and Residual Volume are needed.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text2-1: Tidal Volume (TD)
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text2-2-1: that volume of air moved into or out of the lungs during quiet breathing (it is bordered by
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text2-2-2: red dashed lines
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text2-2-3: on a right chart
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text2-3: The healthy adult's TV value should be 15 - 18 % of his Forced Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text3-1: Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV)
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text3-2: the maximal volume of air that can be exhaled from the end-expiratory position.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text3-3: The healthy adult's ERV should be 25 % of his Forced Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text4-1: Inspiratory Reserve Volume (ERV)
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text4-2: the maximal volume that can be inhaled from the end-inspiratory level.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text4-3: The healthy adult's IRV should be 60 % of his Forced Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text5-1: Residual Volume (RV)
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text5-2: the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation.
  first-chapter.supchapter3.text5-3: It is not possible to measure this volume directlly. For that reason we are not going to work deeper with it now.
  first-chapter.problem-1-1: What is the patient's Forced Vital Capacity?
  first-chapter.problem-1-2-1: Is there a difference between our patient's measured forced vital capacity and a forced vital capacity of a healthy, 56 years old, 171 cm high man?

  first-chapter.result.text2-1: RED BORDERED GRAPH
  first-chapter.result.text2-2: It is a different representation of a Spirometry curve of the previously solved problems (problem 1.1 - 1.6)
  first-chapter.result.text2-3: The first rectangle represents healthy human's (predict) RV, ERV, IRV and TV values.
  first-chapter.result.text2-4: The second and the third rectangle represent the patient's results (the first one - stats from the first measurement, the second one - stats from the second measurement).
  first-chapter.result.text2-5: Comparing these three graphs, doctor can immediately recognize, if the patient's measured values are increased/decreased or normal.
  first-chapter.result.text3-1: ORANGE BORDERED GRAPH
  first-chapter.result.text3-2: The difference between FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) and VC (Slow Vital Capacity) is in the exhalation.
  first-chapter.result.text3-3: If a doctor asks a patient to exhale calmly and slowly, we are talking about Slow Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.result.text3-4: Contrarily, if the patient is exhaling forcefully and quickly, we are talking about Forced Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.result.text3-5: Exhaled air volume should be equal in both exhalation ways for a healthy human. If there is a big difference, we can expect Obstructive disease in our patient.
  first-chapter.result.text3-6: In our problems we are not differentiating between values FVC and VC. We are always using FVC as a patient's Vital Capacity.
  first-chapter.result.next: Finally... GAME TIME
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-1: There were many famous doctors studying human Vital Capacity during the last centuries.
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-2: One of the first was Galen, well-known famous Greek doctor (2th century).
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-3: Later, Giovannin Alfonso Borelli (1679) rapidly increased the measurement accuracy, using the patient's nose blocking.
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-4: John Hutchinson (1849) created the first fully functional spirometer (water spirometer). Later, based on 4000 measurements, found a linear dependence between the vital capacity and a human height.
  table.FVC-text-introduction: As a height unit, INCH is used in a table. Inches are usually used in an anglophone districts, most common in the USA and the United Kingdom (1 inch = 2.54 cm).

  diseases.header: Pulmonary diseases
  diseases.introduction: Pulmonary diseases can be divided into three groups.
  diseases.header-11: Restrictive lung diseases
  diseases.header-12: Obstructive lung diseases
  diseases.header-13: Restrictive and Obstructive lung diseases combination
  diseases.header-14: Spirometry is not the only one assessment necessary to diagnose and to confirm a patient's disease. Very important are also -  patient's anamnesis, x-ray, CT scan, bronchoscopy and others.
  diseases.table1.text-1: Restrictive lung diseases - Spirometry results
  diseases.table2.text-1: Obstructive lung diseases - Spirometry results
  diseases.table1.text-2: Parameter
  diseases.table1.text-3: A spirometry assessment result and a predicted value comparison
  diseases.table1.text-4: Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)
  diseases.table1.text-5: FVC is reduced below 80% of a predicted value
  diseases.table2.text-5: FVC is normal or nearly normal (lightly decreased)
  diseases.table1.text-6: Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)
  diseases.table1.text-7: FEV1 is reduced below 80% of a predicted value
  diseases.table1.text-8: FEV1/FVC ratio (FEV1%)
  diseases.table1.text-9: FEV1/FVC ratio is normal (value = 1)
  diseases.table2.text-9: FEV1/FVC ratio is reduced on a value 0.7 or less (max value = 1)
  diseases.table1.text-10: Peak expiratory flow (PEF)
  diseases.table1.text-11: PEF is reduced or normal
  diseases.table2.text-11: PEF is reduced below 80% of a predicted value. The reduction is increasing with the disease substantiality (ASTHMA - low reduction, COPD - height reduction).
  diseases.table1.text-12: Forced expiratory flow (FEF)
  diseases.table2.text-13: FEF25, FEF50 and FEF75 are reduced below 50% of a predicted value. The reduction is increasing with the disease substantiality.
  diseases.table1.text-13: FEF25, FEF50 and FEF75 values can be lightly reduced or extended, based on a FVC change
  diseases.table1.text-14: Flow-Volume Loop shape
  diseases.table1.text-15: Concave in a volume axis direction
  diseases.table2.text-15: Convex in a volume axis direction
  diseases.note-1: The table does not contain PEAK INSPIRATORY FLOW (PIF) which represents the maximal air flow during the patient's inhalation. The reason is medical. The inspiration curve is less influenced by the lung defects as the expiratory curve. If the value of this parameter is reduced compared to the expected value, we usually have to find the cause outside of the lung (e.g. trachea cancer).
  diseases.note-2: COPD is one of the most common pulmonary obstructive diseases, mostly caused by smoking. There are two COPD forms - chronical bronchitis and aerification. Patients suffering from COPD usually have both of these forms.
  diseases.part-11-text-1: Restrictive pulmonary diseases are also known as restrictive ventilatory defects or interstitial lung diseases.
  diseases.part-11-header-1: What is happening in a patient's respiratory system?
  diseases.part-11-text-2: The lung tissue is defected what causes decreased air volume stored in a lung.
  diseases.part-11-header-2: How are the restrictive lung diseases demonstrated by the Spirometry assessment?
  diseases.part-11-header-3: What are the causes of restrictive lung diseases?
  diseases.part-11-text-3: The causes can be splited into the two main categories:
  diseases.part-11-text-3-1: Extrinsic (they are influencing the chest wall movement)
  diseases.part-11-text-3-1-1: Obesity
  diseases.part-11-text-3-1-2: Scoliosis
  diseases.part-11-text-3-1-3: Respiratory muscle defects
  diseases.part-11-text-3-1-4: ...
  diseases.part-11-text-3-2: Intrinsic (they are influencing the lung elasticity)
  diseases.part-11-text-3-2-1: Partial surgery lung removal
  diseases.part-11-text-3-2-2: Sarcoidosis
  diseases.part-11-text-3-2-3: Pulmonary fibrosis
  diseases.part-11-text-3-2-4: ...
  diseases.part-12-text-1: Bronchi and bronchioles are narrowed what caueses the airway obstruction. The result of the obstruction is a reduction of a quickly exhaled air.
  diseases.part-12-text-3-1: Asthma
  diseases.part-12-text-3-2: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
  diseases.part-13-text-1: The restrictive and obstructive disease combination can be caused by two different diseases where the first one is restrictive and the second one is obstructive.
  diseases.part-13-text-2: Another option is, if the disease causes both - restrictive as well as obstructive pulmonary defects. The example of this kind of disease is a cystic fibrosis.
