  introduction.part1.slogan: Mathematics doesn't have to be an "apparition"
  introduction.part1.headline: Mathematics in Medicine
  introduction.part1.text1-1: Have you ever heard about the "importance of mathematics in medicine". Do you believe it? Can you imagine why should be mathematics important to medicine? How can we REALY use our mathematical knowledge in this field?
  introduction.part1.text1-2: The answer to these questions is offered on the next pages.
  introduction.part1.text1-3: We are looking together to a result of medical assessment called SPIROMETRY. By solving small problems, step by step, we are discovering how this result is constructed and why is the mathematics necessary in this process.
  introduction.part2.slogan: A Medical Assessment
  introduction.part2.headline:  Spirometry?
  introduction.part2.text2-1: Spirometry is a medical assessment which helps doctors to test the pulmonary function - function of our lungs. Practically, it measures the movement of air into and out of the lungs.
  introduction.part2.text2-2: Spirometry in the past
  introduction.part2.text2-3: One of the first constructed spirometer is called WATER SPIROMETER. As you can see in the picture (left), the patient was breathing into a machine. The machine was drawing graph - spirometry curve based on the patient's breathing intensity.
  introduction.part2.text2-4: Spirometry today
  introduction.part2.text2-5: Modern spirometers are small computer machines connected to the breathing mouthpiece (picture right). Assessment result is printed from the computer to the paper sheet.
  introduction.part3.slogan: Computers help
  introduction.part3.headline:  Spirometry Result
  introduction.part3.text3-1: To help a doctor make a diagnosis, the modern computer assessment result does not contain only siprometry curve, but also:
  introduction.part3.text3-2: o Key measured values
  introduction.part3.text3-3: o Volume-Time curve
  introduction.part3.text3-4: o Flow-Volume loop
  introduction.part3.text3-5: o Comparable values (values, which should be achieved by a healthy man/woman)
  introduction.part3.text3-6: To understand how this WHOLE result is beeing created inside "in the computer" and what the numbers and curves can tell the doctor about patients healthy conditions - these are our tasks for the next pages.
  introduction.part4.slogan: Mathematics hidden inside
  introduction.part4.headline: What can I expect from Mathematics?

  first-chapter.subchapter1.headline:
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-1: One of the main patient's respiratory problem indicators is a (FORCED) VITAL CAPACITY denoted by FVC.

  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-3: The healthy, non-smoker human's FVC is defined by
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-4: TABLES
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-5: If the patient's FVC is different from the table - predicted value, it can signalize various types of diseases.
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-6: Why do we need this information?
  first-chapter.subchapter1.text1-7: Our first task is to FIND PATIENT'S FORCED VITAL CAPACITY and to COMPARE IT with a table (predicted) value. If there is nearly no difference between these two values, we are not expecting patient's lung function problems.

  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-1: There were many famous doctors studying human Vital Capacity during the last centuries.
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-2: One of the first was Galen, well-known famous Greek doctor (2th century).
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-3: Later, Giovannin Alfonso Borelli (1679) rapidly increased the measurement accuracy, using the patient's nose blocking.
  first-chapter.historical-block-text-1-4: John Hutchinson (1849) created the first fully functional spirometer (water spirometer). Later, based on 4000 measurements, found a linear dependence between the vital capacity and a human height.
  table.FVC-text-introduction: As the height unit, the INCH is used in a table. Inches are usually used in an anglophone districts, most common in the USA and the United Kingdom (1 inch = 2.54 cm).

  diseases.table1.text-15: Concave in a volume axis direction
  diseases.note-1: The table does not contain PEAK INSPIRATORY FLOW (PIF) which represents the maximal air flow during the patient's inhalation. The reason is medical. The inspiration curve is less influenced by the lung defects as the expiratory curve. If the value of this parameter is reduced compared to the expected value, we usually have to find the cause outside of the lung (e.g. trachea cancer).

  diseases.part-11-header-1: What is happening in a patient's respiratory system?
  diseases.part-11-text-2: The lung tissue is defected. That defect causes decreased air volume stored in the lung.
  diseases.part-11-header-2: How are the restrictive lung diseases demonstrated by the Spirometry assessment?
  diseases.part-11-header-3: What are the causes of restrictive lung diseases?
